# EnFER-ViT: Optimized Ensemble Deep Learning for Accurate Emotion Recognition With Visual Transformers
Abstract—Within human-computer interaction, effectively
identifying human emotions based on facial expressions is an
obstacle, primarily due to facial clues and intricate nature. This
thesis presents a deep learning system that combines the capabilities of CNNs, specifically ResNet-50 and Efficient-Net, using
an innovative ensemble model. This model is developed using
Bayesian Optimization to systematically tune hyperparameters,
aiming to enhance the precision and reliability of emotion recognition and optimize its performance. The study utilizes advanced
CK+ and FER-2013 datasets, which have been enhanced using
the ORB algorithm. This augmentation procedure improves the
training data and strengthens the model’s capability to detect
subtle emotion-related characteristics of facial expressions. Our
methodology involves preprocessing the data using the ORB
algorithm to improve feature extraction. Additionally, we apply
image augmentation techniques to tackle the difficulties presented
by the wide range and intricacy of facial emotions. The proposed
ensemble method also uses individual models to understand facial
emotions thoroughly. Enhancing the model’s hyperparameters
using Bayesian Optimization ensures that the model functions
optimally while learning from Ck+ and FER-2013 datasets. The
proposed Ensemble Model in emotion recognition demonstrates
exceptional performance by effectively balancing high accuracy
and the capability to manage unbalanced datasets. More precisely, the ensemble model surpasses conventional deep learning
models with an accuracy rate of 96.97% & 83.63%.
